## About the Project

On August 2019, the [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile/) YouTube channel posted a series of three videos in which the mathematician Neil J. A. Sloane presents amazing graphs generated by particular mathematical sequences.
I wanted to reproduce these graphs myself and I present the result in this article. This article is not yet finished, other sequences will be added shortly.

Amazing Graphs trilogy :
  
  1. [Amazing Graphs - Numberphile](https://youtu.be/pAMgUB51XZA)
  2. [Amazing Graphs II (including Star Wars) - Numberphile](https://youtu.be/o8c4uYnnNnc)
  3. [Amazing Graphs III - Numberphile](https://youtu.be/j0o-pMIR8uk)

Neil J. A. Sloane is known for having founded the OEIS, a book and then a website on which hundreds of thousands of mathematical sequences are referenced. I strongly encourage you to visit the [OEIS website](https://oeis.org/).

## How to use this Code

To run my code, you will need the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library. Matplotlib is a complete library for creating static, animated and interactive visualizations in Python.

### Installing Matplotlib

You will find all the information necessary for its installation on the following page : <https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html>
